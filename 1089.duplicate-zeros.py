# Testcase Example:  '[1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]'
#
# Given a fixed lengthÂ array arr of integers, duplicate each occurrence of
# zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.
# 
# Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.
# 
# Do the above modifications to the input array in place, do not return
# anything from your function.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
# Output: null
# Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to:
# [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,2,3]
# Output: null
# Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to:
# [1,2,3]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= arr.length <= 10000
# 0 <= arr[i] <= 9
