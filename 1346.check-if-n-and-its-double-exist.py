# Testcase Example:  '[10,2,5,3]'
#
# Given an array arr of integers, check if there exists two integers N and M
# such that N is the double of M ( i.e. N = 2 * M).
# 
# More formally check if there existsÂ two indices i and j such that :
# 
# 
# i != j
# 0 <= i, j < arr.length
# arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [10,2,5,3]
# Output: true
# Explanation: N = 10 is the double of M = 5,that is, 10 = 2 * 5.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [7,1,14,11]
# Output: true
# Explanation: N = 14 is the double of M = 7,that is, 14 = 2 * 7.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [3,1,7,11]
# Output: false
# Explanation: In this case does not exist N and M, such that N = 2 * M.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 2 <= arr.length <= 500
# -10^3 <= arr[i] <= 10^3
