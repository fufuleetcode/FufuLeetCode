#
# Given an array of integers where 1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ n (n = size of array), some
# elements appear twice and others appear once.
# 
# Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
# 
# Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the
# returned list does not count as extra space.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input:
# [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
# 
# Output:
# [5,6]

class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for num in nums:
            if nums[abs(num)-1] > 0:
                nums[abs(num)-1] *= -1
        res = [i+1 for i, v in enumerate(nums) if v > 0]
        return res
